Why is it better to compute and compare log posteriors rather than using the posterior probabilities directly?

>1) Using log represents number more accurately as the numbers get very small. Since with posteriors we will be dealing with very small numbers and multiplication, the numbers get even smaller. 
2) Since there are many multiplications involved, using log makes it simple addition. It is not much of an advantage given that many processors today have hardware multipliers.
