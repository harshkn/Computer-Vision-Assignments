How do you compute the variance of a single principal component?
Why can the variance be obtained in that way?

>
The covariance matrix can be used to compute variance of the single principle component. 

It can be obtained this way because the covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix, and each element in diagonal matrix gives information about the variance from the component from its previous diagonal element.
